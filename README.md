# My Personal Home Page

## Description

This is the distributed repository of my home page.

This is not yet completely finished, but most of the functions, and the information can be seen.

I created my home page using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

All the images are created using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

## Source code

The files in this repository are just the distributed files from my other repository. If you would like to see the main source code, please look at my [Profile](https://github.com/takaneichinose/profile) repository.
